Understanding PC Matic Error Codes
----------------------------------

PC Matic, like many Windows applications, uses error codes to describe issues—ranging from installation failures to update conflicts or invalid license keys. Common error categories include:

- **Installation errors** – e.g., corrupt download, folder permissions
- **License errors** – invalid, expired, or unrecognized key
- **Update/service errors** – unable to fetch definitions or update modules
- **Scan/Performance issues** – sudden termination or inability to access files
- **Uninstall errors** – failure to remove program components

A typical error message might look like:

::

   Error Code: 12345 – Installation failed due to write permission denied

To fix any specific error, first identify its **code** and **full message**, then follow the sections below.

Preparation: Log, Environment, and Backup
-----------------------------------------

Before you begin troubleshooting, gather critical context:

1. **Copy the full error code and details.**  
   Example: _“Error Code: 12345 – Could not write to `C:\Program Files\PC Matic\update.log`.”_

2. **Check system environment.**  
   - Windows version (10, 11, Server, etc.)  
   - Installed antivirus or endpoint products  
   - Recent Windows updates, software installs, or policy changes

3. **Backup your data.**  
   - Ensure restore points are active  
   - Use File History or third‑party tools to back up important files

4. **Collect logs if available.**  
   - PC Matic’s logs often reside in `%ProgramData%\PC Matic\Logs\`

With this information in hand, proceed confidently—and know you can revert your system if needed.

Common Error Codes and Fixes
